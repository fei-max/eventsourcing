# Use Preact BEFORE React on your next website

It's never been easier to spin up a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) project. Here's why you should start with Preact BEFORE graduating to React on your next project ðŸ’ª

Some helpful resources:

- [Spin up a starter project](https://astro.new/framework-preact) with Astro + Preact
- [Set up Preact compat](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/switching-to-preact/#setting-up-compat) in your existing React project to avoid big refactors
