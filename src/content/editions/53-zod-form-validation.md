# Simple full-stack form validation with Zod

Zod is the last form validator I'll ever need 🙏
Let's validate forms on the server and client, no matter the framework, using [zod-form-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod-form-data)!

To try the project from this video, [clone the repository](https://github.com/bholmesdev/astro-zod-form-demo) 👀
